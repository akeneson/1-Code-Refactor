# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

    For this homework assignment, a webpage was given for developers to improve its accessibility for their business, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

    The assignment required developers to ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

    Steps taken in the assignments allowed novice developers to pull from gitlab, as well as push and pull from github. The index.html and style.css file was edited to the business's criteria with comments were then pushed to github for grading.
